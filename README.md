This website was made for my University's COM1008 (Web Systems and Architecture) assignment and utilises HTML/CSS to create a mobile-responsive site showing skills in web development, site accessibility configuration, and cross-browser compatibility. 

Accessibility guidelines and HTML validation were applied to meet WCAG standards, enhancing user experience for all visitors. The mobile-responsive design was done to provide optimal viewing across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Performance optimisation - such as image compression - improved loading times, while cross-browser testing ensured consistent functionality and appearance. Interactive elements, such as quizzes with visual feedback and smooth CSS transitions, were also incorporated to enhance the user experience and engagement.
